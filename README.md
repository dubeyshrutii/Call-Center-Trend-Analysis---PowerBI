### ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

- This project leverages Power BI to analyze call center operations, including total calls, resolution rates, abandoned calls, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.
The goal is to provide insights into peak call times, agent efficiency, and areas needing improvement, ensuring better resource allocation, enhanced service quality, and improved customer experience.

### ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

- How can we reduce abandoned calls and improve resolution rates?
-	Which agents are performing well, and who needs additional support or training?

#### âž¢ Abandoned Calls:

946 calls (18.92%) were abandoned, highlighting a need for better availability during peak hours.

#### âž¢ Average Speed of Answer (Sec):

The average time to answer a call was 67.52 seconds, suggesting some delays in customer connection that could be optimized.

## âœ… Visual Trends and Analysis:

#### 1] Resolved and Unresolved Calls by Month

#### 3] Total Calls by Time of the Day

- Afternoon was the busiest time, with 3,320 calls, making it the peak period for call activity.
- Morning also saw significant traffic, handling around 1,666 calls.
- Calls dropped considerably in the evening, highlighting a need to prioritize staffing during morning and afternoon hours.

#### 4]  Customer Satisfaction:

- The satisfaction ratings were categorized into five levels: Neutral (1,218 customers), Satisfied (1,180 customers), Very Satisfied (843 customers), Very Dissatisfied (417 
  customers), and Dissatisfied (396 customers).
- While the majority of customers fell into the Neutral and Satisfied categories, a significant portion expressed dissatisfaction, highlighting areas for improvement in
