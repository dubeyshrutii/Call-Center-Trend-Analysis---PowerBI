### 🔹 Project Overview

- This project leverages Power BI to analyze call center operations, including total calls, resolution rates, abandoned calls, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.
The goal is to provide insights into peak call times, agent efficiency, and areas needing improvement, ensuring better resource allocation, enhanced service quality, and improved customer experience.

### 🔹 Problem Statement

- How can we reduce abandoned calls and improve resolution rates?
-	Which agents are performing well, and who needs additional support or training?

4,054 calls (81.08%) were successfully answered, showing a good response rate.

#### ➢ Resolved Calls:

3,646 of the answered calls (72.92%) were resolved, while 27.08% remained unresolved, indicating areas for process improvement.

#### ➢ Abandoned Calls:

946 calls (18.92%) were abandoned, highlighting a need for better availability during peak hours.

#### ➢ Average Speed of Answer (Sec):

The average time to answer a call was 67.52 seconds, suggesting some delays in customer connection that could be optimized.

## ✅ Visual Trends and Analysis:

#### 1] Resolved and Unresolved Calls by Month

-	February and March showed slightly lower call volumes but maintained consistent resolution rates.

#### 2] Answered and Abandoned Calls by Call Types

-	Streaming and Payment Issues had the highest abandonment rates, highlighting areas needing improvement.
-	Technical Support calls had better resolution rates, reflecting more effective handling.

#### 3] Total Calls by Time of the Day

- Afternoon was the busiest time, with 3,320 calls, making it the peak period for call activity.
- Morning also saw significant traffic, handling around 1,666 calls.
- Calls dropped considerably in the evening, highlighting a need to prioritize staffing during morning and afternoon hours.

#### 4]  Customer Satisfaction:

- The satisfaction ratings were categorized into five levels: Neutral (1,218 customers), Satisfied (1,180 customers), Very 
  Satisfied (843 customers), Very Dissatisfied (417 
  customers), and Dissatisfied (396 customers).
- While the majority of customers fell into the Neutral and Satisfied categories, a significant portion expressed 
  dissatisfaction, highlighting areas for improvement in service quality and resolution efficiency.


## 🔥 Recommendations:

- Increase staffing during peak hours (11 AM–3 PM) and high-traffic days (Monday and Saturday) to reduce abandoned calls 
  and improve response times.
- Enhance resolution processes and provide targeted training to agents to address the 27% unresolved calls, boosting 
  customer trust and retention.
- Reduce the average speed of answer (67 seconds) by streamlining call routing and ensuring agents are readily available 
  during peak hours.
- Focus on Streaming and Payment-related issues, which contribute significantly to abandoned calls, by improving agent 
  expertise and providing proactive support.
- Invest in training programs and tools to improve resolution speed and service quality, shifting more customers from 
  neutral to satisfied or very satisfied categories.
